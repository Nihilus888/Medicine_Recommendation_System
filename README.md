# Elliott Tay's Portfolio

I decided to create a new portfolio using next.js as I decide to pick up a new technology and next.js seems to be the latest thing in the tech market. 
With the help of some youtube videos, documentations and ChatGPT, it gave me a structure on how I should create and design this website. There were some difficulties
in deploying this website to vercel as there were some compatibility issues in the files and what not. The good thing is that it was just some issues with apostrophes and some issue with
the file names.
